# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Task 1

Todo List

# Custom hooks

support reusable logic
*eager return: return value is available immediately.
*lazy return: return value is available only after the hook is called
\*debouncing: delaying the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed since the last time the function was called(custom hook)
